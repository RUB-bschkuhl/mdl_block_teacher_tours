# Teacher Tours Block

The purpose of the Teacher Tours Block is to provide course intructors with the possibilty to create user tours for their courses. What is included in the block are options to create and delete user tours for the specific course, add and delete new steps to the tour (including a title and description) and create and delete a single entry point for a specific tour in the form of a button that can be placed in the header or at the top of a section.

The plugin was created by Bastian Schmidt-Kuhl, Nihaal Shaikh, Christan Wolters, Nikolai Jahreis and Julien Breunig during the MoodleMoot DACH 2025 in LÃ¼beck.

Students can start the tour, once set as available by clicking the start button placed by the tour creator, whenever it is suitable for them.
